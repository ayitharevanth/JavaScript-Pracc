//INTRO TO JS

/*
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive 
e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.
JavaScript is considered cross-platform because it can be executed on various operating systems and 
devices without modification, as long as there's a compatible JavaScript runtime environment available.
breifly we can say that JS can run on different OS's with the same code base until that OS has JS runtime 
environment like a web browser.

JS is a dynamic language.

client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as 
mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from 
one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).

A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on 
a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.

console.log("Hello World"); //inside "" we always input a string
window.alert("Hello World"); // it will show an alert on browser. (run this on browser)

/*
There are some features which are not available in java script language but we use those features from the browser with the help of java script.
window object = it is an object which contains all the fetures related to a browser.
window is a box of features given by browser to use with js.
Ex: window.alert() = alert() is not the part of js but it is a part of window.

console.log(window);  //(run this on browser)
